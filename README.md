# THIS PROJECT HAS BEEN DEPRECATED FOR NOW UNTIL I FIGURE OUT WHAT TO DO WITH IT
# ... but I need some quick way of pulling in all my settings to a new box.
# Maybe a Keybase repo.

# tl;dr:

`curl -L http://bit.ly/boot-dot-rot | bash && source ~/.bash_profile`


# Dependencies

- Git (obvs)
- Curl
- Ruby >= 1.8.7
- RubyGems
- Rake
